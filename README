Sam and Gunnar's RenPy Parser (name pending)

The goal of this code is to create an HTML graph visualization of a game's decision tree

it shouldn't require any special dependencies or building, just run the main function from the main module.

Major Modules
    - Lexer.hs handles turning the RenPy script into tokens
    - TokenParser.hs turns the list of tokens into a list of ASTs
    - Main.hs turns the list of ASTs into a graph structure 
    - HTMLify.hs and Dotify.hs turn the graph structure into an HTML or DOT file.
